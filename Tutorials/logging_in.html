<h1>Logging in</h1>

For operations on private data, such as that data stored in your
workspace, you will need to be logged in. You can check to see if you
are already logged in using the p3-whoami command:

<pre>
$ p3-whoami
You are logged in as:
brettin@patricbrc.org
</pre>

<p>
If you were not logged in, when you run the p3-whoami command you
would see that you are not logged in. If this were the case, you would
not be able to upload to your workspace or see any of the data in your
workspace for example.
<p>
<pre>
$ p3-whoami
You are not logged in.
</pre>
 
<p>

If you are not logged in, you can do so using the p3-login
command. Notice that your user name contains the suffix
“@patricbrc.org”. This suffix is required so that your PATRIC
credentials are used rather than your RAST credentials. 

<pre>
$ p3-login brettin@patricbrc.org
Password: ****
Logged in with username brettin@patricbrc.org
$ p3-whoami
You are logged in as:
brettin@patricbrc.org
</pre>
